### PyBer_Analysis

##1.Overview of the analysis: 
We created an analysis of Ride Sharing data with two data sets. One for cities and other for rides. 
Using matplotlib, pandas and Jupyter notebook, we compared the quantity and costs of rides in every city type: urban, suburban and rural. 

## 2.Results
![Summary dataframe by city type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108194577/182003557-fbdfabc1-9d92-4fd8-bc2e-0e680e378ab9.PNG)
 
 In this picture we can see that Urban cities have more demand than Rural city type but the average per driver in Urban cities is way more smaller than Rural. This is due to the amount of drivers on the Urban cities. In this case in Urban, we have more drivers than trips, so in order to increase the Average Fare per driver, it will be recommended to create incentives for the clients to level up the Average Fare per Driver.
 
 In the other hand, the Rural Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Drivers is higher, because the number of drivers is smaller and the demand is higher. In this case, the recommendation will be to create incentives to the drivers, so we can have more drivers in order to decrease the Average Fare per Ride.

## 3. Summary

One recomendations is to increase the incentives for drivers to the Rural cities so we can increase the number of drivers. 
Urban cities, create incentives for the clients so they order more rides in order to level the total of rides and the total of drivers.

We can also compare the time of the rides so we can determine the Average fer per ride more exact between city types.
